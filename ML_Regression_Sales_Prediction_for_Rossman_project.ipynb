Because store types A and C accounted for the bulk of the stores, they had the highest overall income figures despite having very identical \"per customer and per store\" sales figures. Store Type B, on the other hand, was extremely small in number, but even so, its average sales were higher than those of the others.\n",

        "* It was previously noted that only store type B had all three types of assortment levels, while the other store types only had two.
